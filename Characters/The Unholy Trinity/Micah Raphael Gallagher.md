# Biography

## Early Life

Micah was born to Tammy and Howard Gallagher in 1995 in Albany, NY. His parents' marriage was rocky, and did not improve in his childhood. Tammy was religious, and as her faith grew intensity, so did her distance to Howard. When Micah was seven, his parents divorced. His mother moved to the Hudson Valley area downstate with Micah while Howard relocated to Arizona. Howard's contact with his wife and child when Micah was around ten. He pays a moderate fee for child support and occasionally sends Micah birthday cards.

After Howard's departure, Tammy's religious fervor grew. She and Micah attended church two to four times a week until Micah was approximately sixteen; at this point he ceased going. Tammy's faith only escalated as Micah encountered typical adolescent challenges and grew into adulthood. At canon's start, she is involved in church five to six days a week and has begun to believe the apocalypse is approaching



### Relationship with Tammy

Micah's relationship with his mother sours with time, due in part to normal adolescent angst and in part to Tammy's increasing fanaticism. In general, Tammy is overbearing, sheltering, and controlling, which leads in part to Micah remaining at home long after graduating high school.



### Discovery of Powers & Turn to Religion

At thirteen, after a particularly intense first sexual experience related to his best friend, Peter, Micah had his first prophetic dream. The dream involves several key prophecies, including meeting Jules and Luc, Peter and Tammy's later deaths, and the meeting of Pestilence. This dream and discussion of it with Peter Underwood temporarily heightens Micah's own religious belief and desire to be a part of his mother's (and the Underwood family's) church. He looks up to Peter, who is several years older than Micah.

Throughout Micah's early teen-hood, overlapping for a few years with his friendship with Jules and Luc, Micah is intensely devout to a strain of Christianity that can best be described as edgy, modern Protestantism that is obsessed with moral purity beneath its Christ-Warrior veneer. Micah is constantly being judged for his doubts, perceived as a lack of faith, as well as personal failings--the beginnings of his mental illness, his lack of a father figure, and his latent homosexuality (see below).



### Repressed Sexuality

Despite Micah's first sexual experience being more or less one of the same sex, his religious beliefs, family pressure, and the outspoken bigotry of his peers kept Micah not only closeted, but in denial throughout his youth. Even as his internet friendships deepened and those companions came out, Micah was deeply personally homophobic and often got into fist fights (sometimes while intoxicated) at the mere suggestion of gay behavior from himself or those close to him. These fights were occasionally started intentionally when he caught himself having "impure thoughts," especially of Lucian and/or Julian.



## Friendship with Jules and Luc

Micah kept a blog revolving around his dreams and his dark, somewhat goth aesthetic from the age of about 15 onward. This is not official canon, but it has been discussed as authors that some details in Micah's dreams and/or tags on his blog drew Julian and Lucian's attention and the boys hit it off as online acquaintances and, eventually, friends. 

Though the boys became close several years before canon start, they have never met, due to extenuating circumstances and (in Micah and Jules's case) complex family dynamics.

Throughout their friendship, Micah has become increasingly attracted to them, especially to Lucian, but has continued denying his feelings.



## Killing Tammy & Leaving NY

Micah reconnects with Peter on Halloween. Peter is very drunk, and Micah takes him home to keep him safe/sober him up. Peter makes some kind of romantic or sexual overture to Micah, which Tammy sees. Tammy's religious fervor has mixed with what is probably genetic psychosis to make her think Peter is going to corrupt Micah (further, as she has previously expressed that she believes he may be possessed) and she strikes him in the head, accidentally killing him. Enraged and conflicted, Micah stabs her to death and then calls Jules for help. Jules helps coordinate Micah's escape from the area with help from Lucifer, who has been working with Jules to funnel money in preparation for the trinity uniting.

Micah "borrows" a truck from his employer to make it to the nearest city, where Lucifer (through Jules) has recently prepared a fake identity for Micah as well as funds for the Trinity to settle in Ohio. Micah then takes a Greyhound to Cuyahoga, OH, where he meets Jules and Lucian in person for the first time

# POWERS & LIMITATIONS

## Powers

Unlike his companions, Micah has no physical magic powers or manifestations, and is more fully human than his friends. Though he has a **talent for art,** his only supernatural gift known at this time is his prophetic dreams, visions, and ability to summon those things.


### Prophecy

Micah's prophecies originally manifest (from ages 13 to 23) as dreams. These dreams are not always straight-forward coherent visions, but contain kernels of decipherable facts and events.

At 23, after being hospitalized for insomnia-induced psychosis triggered by an attempt to *avoid *the dreams, Micah's visions begin to manifest while awake. These waking visions are somewhat more coherent, though not always. 

After meeting Lucifer and learning more about the powers they have as a Trinity, it's revealed that much of the information in his prophecies is pulled from failed timelines, where the Unholy Trinity refused, failed, or was prevented from starting the apocalypse.

#### Prophecy by Choice / Resurrecting Past Micahs

After his quest with [[Pestilence]], Micah gains the ability to pull memories from past timelines more or less at will. However, the catch is that the consciousness from that timeline then attempts to merge with the post-quest/canon Micah. As the timelines are forced to cross temporarily, our Micah if physically affected by whatever is physically affecting the other, alternate Micahs--and since Micah is the linch-pin of the [[Time Loops]], these physical conditions are often grave or fatal injuries, requiring Jules to be present to consistently necromance Micah away from death in the main/canon timeline. This merging threatens Micah's human cognition as well as his body, since the brain cannot hold conflicting memories of multiple lifetimes. 

Successful prophecies come when Micah is able to hold parallel consciousness with an alternate version of himself long enough to access relevant memories, but not long enough for his physical injuries to kill him *or* for his consciousness to be forced to merge with the other.

## Limitations


### Dissociative & Fugue States

There are times in Micah's life, between when prophetic vision appear during waking hours and when he gets full control of his powers, where he is unable to tell what's real and what's not. Occasionally, in other timelines|[[Time Loops]], this has ended in the deaths of one or more Trinity members.

In this Main Timeline, this sometimes puts Micah into psychotic-like states where he reacts unpredictably and violently to perceived threats. At least once, this causes Jules and Luc to [restrain him to the bed](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NuWv7nDoxAlKdtkdx7ip90hJUeXUpdX3BGCT3qEZFFE/edit?usp=sharing%20).

### Time Loops

The cause of the [[Time Loops]] is not official in canon, although it's been discussed and inferred as authors that they are caused either by the angels, the [[Horsemen]], or negotiated by Death as a fair battle-ground for control of the fate of humanity.

Time loops are dependent upon Micah's life (or whoever is the Prophet in the timeline, in some cases). When Micah dies, the timeline resets. Jules's and Lucian's lifespans are not affected by Micah's death, and in doomed timelines, they simply live out the rest of their lives until their deaths before they are reset. In failed timelines where the Apocalypse does not occur, and Micah does not die of traumatic events, the boys live natural lifespans until Micah's death and then the timeline is "set aside" and the loop begins again.

### Humanity

Unlike Lucian and Julian, who are half or more non-human entities, Micah is a human gifted with one supernatural power. While his friends extol the virtues of this humanity, it puts Micah at a physical, spiritual, and magical disadvantage against almost every entity he encounters after leaving New York. He is physically and magically weakest, he ages, he can fall ill or be injured, and he has no supernatural defense against spiritual attacks.
