# BIOGRAPHY

## Early Life / Appearance of Powers

Jules was born on 6 October 1995 in St. Paul, Minnesota, USA to Eleonora (née Salvatore) and Marcello Casimir. He was named Julian because of his mother's preference for the English form of Giuliano, and Gabriel because of his parents' faith. He was raised in a strict Catholic household--- the kind that didn't approve of books like Harry Potter and Percy Jackson, although he would spend recess in the school library reading them anyway. His parents had him baptized two weeks after he was born, with his uncle Lucio Casimir standing witness as his godfather. However, when the holy water touched him, he screamed and thrashed, unable to be calmed for nearly thirty minutes afterwards. This event began his parents' unease and dislike of him, which grew as he did.

It was noticed early on that Jules was a very distracted child, and spoke of seeing lights and colors that no one else could. His parents discouraged this consistently enough that he eventually ceased to mention them, but they didn't go away. In school it was hard for him to focus, so curious about the ebbs and flows of the colorful auras he saw on his classmates and the occasional shadows that plagued his teachers.

At 8, he was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Adderall. Unfortunately, not only was the medication ineffective in remedying his distraction, but it also stimulated his latent magical abilities. 'Accidental magic' as seen in Harry Potter--- which his reading of may or may not have affected the development of his magic--- was an apt comparison to what occurred, though his parents felt it was more 'demonic' than 'magical.'

Less than a year of this led to the decision to perform an exorcism. The church the family had been going to since before Jules was born would have no part in it, and so his parents found one that would: a much more fanatical parish than they had ever been a part of. They took to it immediately, and stayed even after the exorcism had no obvious effect. Taking Jules off his medication was the next step, and thankfully for all involved, that worked much better.

As he aged, Jules grew less and less interested in religion, and in his parents' version of it especially. He learned quickly not to touch the holy water, for the pain it caused never lessened with exposure. After he'd mastered enough sleight of hand to fool his parents into believing he'd eaten the communion wafer(which, in addition to the wine, gave him intense heartburn to consume), he felt that the church had nothing left to teach him. That, of course, did not get him out of going. Every Sunday he went to mass, and every Wednesday night he went to youth classes, bother without a hint of protest--- he knew it wouldn't do any good to complain.

Around 15, he began his online friendship with Micah and Luci.



## Leaving Home / Life Homeless

When he was 16, his mother caught him mid-makeout session with a male classmate, and that was the final straw. She shouted loud enough to draw his father, and within seconds their decision to throw him out was made. They tossed both him and his paramour out the door immediately. Said paramour was more concerned about the fact that Jules's parents might tell his own and ran off, and Jules never saw him again. Jules hung around the nearby park until night fell and then snuck back in his bedroom window to retrieve everything that mattered to him, as well as steal some food and money.

He made his way to a LGBT homeless shelter and stayed only long enough to get his bearings because of the hints the ones in charge made towards calling child services, which he did not want to deal with. Jules moved between shelters from then on, occasionally lying about his age where required, and sometimes slept in parks or alleys if he'd overstayed his welcome. He saved enough money to try for an apartment on his 18th birthday, but most wouldn't rent to him. They gave flimsy excuses or simply slammed the door in his face. A few that did accept him, able to find no plausible excuse not to, quickly found reasons to have him evicted. One, around seven months into his search, seemed to be working out, but then the landlord was replaced by someone whose aura made Jules so uneasy that he left on his own.

Eventually, he gave up and made the best of life on the streets. He figured out a system of rooves and alleys and trees, gyms and store bathrooms, libraries and 24-hour fast food joints, panhandling and sleight of hand magic tricks that let him live, if not comfortably, at least well enough to usually keep himself fed. He took to sneaking into the local community colleges--- mostly to attend classes on programming and cyber defense, but also to participate in martial arts clubs, the skills he learned from which saved his life more than once. Soon he knew just enough computing to get hired for certain sketchy online jobs, and those paid for better food for him and his snake.

## Discovery of Powers

When Jules was 19, he one day paid less attention to Godric than he should have. The shelter he was in at the time happened to have a homeless man with a particular hatred for snakes, and on sighting Godric, he crushed the snake's head under his boot. Jules immediately felt something was wrong and went looking for his friend. When he found Godric, he was horrified, but when he reached out to touch, the snake slowly began to reform before his eyes. Within minutes, Godric was just as alive and healthy as he'd been when Jules had last seen him.

Jules was fascinated. Was it Godric that was an immortal snake, or did it have something to do with Jules's own ability to see departing souls? Over the next few days, he kept on the lookout for dead animals, and with a touch revived the next roadkill he found.

Suddenly, anything was possible. Jules began to test other forms of magic, and most worked--- after much trial and error, and long days and nights of concentrated effort.

# STORYLINE

## Beginnings

When canon starts, Jules is 23 and still living on the streets. His system is working out well enough that he's only mildly concerned for the approaching Minnesota winter. He frequently gets work from a mysterious, moderately suspicious online persona calling himself Lucifer. These jobs range from creating believable false identities to skimming hundreds of dollars off of unsavory people's bank accounts. He spends most of his days doing magic tricks on the curb for cash and chatting with Luci and Micah on his phone.

When Micah murders his mother, Tammy, it sets many things in motion: Jules realizing Lucifer is much more than he appears, a frantic half-hour of planning Micah's escape via Greyhound bus routes, and an exhausting, sleepless night keeping track of Micah's progress and catching a flight to Ohio to finally meet up with him and Luci.



# RELATIONSHIPS

## Family
------

### Parents

![](https://slimwiki.com/api/accounts/the-real-unholy-trinity/attachments/62646)

Jules's relationship with his parents was lukewarm at best. His mother Eleonora (right, FC: Jasmine Trinca) and his father Marcello (left, FC: Tenoch Huerta) cared for his physical needs, but rarely his emotional ones, and often scorned or outright forbid things he was interested in and enjoyed. They refused to allow him to spend time with friends they didn't approve of--- which was, to a one, all of them. He often escaped the house to nearby parks and public libraries, though even visits to these places were limited by his parents' moods.

When he was 16, they threw him out with barely a second thought after catching him kissing a boy in his bedroom, and he hasn't seen them since.

### Godfather

![](https://slimwiki.com/api/accounts/the-real-unholy-trinity/attachments/62645)

Lucio Casimir (FC: Marcello Cruz) kept Jules from truly believing the things his parents tried to teach him during his formative years. He was devout, but in a very different way, and often spoke to Jules of God's unconditional love and acceptance--- including of himself: a gay man of faith. Even when Jules expressed doubts about whether he believed or not, his uncle supported him, saying that questioning was a natural part of having faith, and that no matter what conclusion he came to, Lucio would always love him.

It was, perhaps, inevitable that Lucio would be Jules's first crush. Nothing ever came of it besides a young Jules ogling his uncle's arms whenever they were on display--- Jules never spoke of it, and Lucio never brought it up, if he'd noticed at all. They remained close until the day Lucio came out to his family, including Jules's parents, who forbade Lucio to see Jules again. Every few months, prior to his moving away when Jules was 15, he visited Jules in secret. Jules kept his homelessness from his godfather, who now lived on another continent and often had less money than even Jules himself. They exchanged emails at least twice a week until Lucio was killed in a gay nightclub shooting during a rare visit to his partner's US dwelling family, two years before canon start.

## Godric
------

### History

![](https://slimwiki.com/api/accounts/the-real-unholy-trinity/attachments/62578)

At 13, Jules went to the Como Zoo on a field trip. In the tropical exhibit, a special presentation was happening that day--- a showing of various rare, dangerous snakes. Jules was enthralled. When later, the red-headed krait escaped his distracted handlers and impressively managed to get as far as the polar bear exhibit before becoming too cold to continue, Jules found him and decided to smuggle him home instead of returning him to his captors. Miraculously--- or, more likely, because of unnoticed use of his innate gift of necromancy--- the snake recovered from the cold as Jules hid him under his t-shirt, and never once threatened to bite.

Almost immediately, his parents discovered the newly-named Godric--- after Godric Gryffindor--- and threw him out. The snake, however, had taken a liking to Jules, and no matter how many times he was tossed outside, or how far away he was released into the wild, he always came back. More than once, Jules's father tried killing Godric, but somehow(again, likely the result of fortuitous necromancy), the injuries never stuck. Eventually, Jules got better at hiding him, and let his parents think their attempts to rid themselves of the reptile had worked.

### Species

The red-headed krait is named for its coloring, with its head and tail being bright red and its body being almost completely black, apart from the white stripes that run along its sides. It has been known to grow to two metres long, although Godric is only five feet. Native to lowland rainforests, it usually preys on other snakes, lizards, and rodents. Its venom is highly toxic, though it rarely bites unless strenuously provoked.

### Living Conditions

Godric lives either on Jules's person, under his clothes and against his skin for warmth, or in an old toolbox at the bottom of Jules's backpack. The box is lined with the thin, foil inside of a self-heating cat bed, and filled halfway with reptisoil for comfort and further insulation. Regular placement of hand warmer packs keep the box at suitable temperatures. Once a week, Godric is fed a dead rat.

### Undead?

Jules's necromantic magic has kept his snake alive since nearly the moment they met. Godric will likely live as long as Jules, no matter what injuries he experiences. So far, he has recovered quickly from wounds such as: severe hypothermia, a broken spine, a crushed skull, and numerous gashes and abrasions after the application of a lawnmower. Luckily, he does not seem to feel pain.

## Micah Gallagher
---------------

*Main article: [[Micah Raphael Gallagher | Micah Gallagher]]

![](https://slimwiki.com/api/accounts/the-real-unholy-trinity/attachments/62584)

Jules's friendship with Micah (FC: Tristan Lake Leabu) formed alongside his friendship with Luci, around the time they were all 15. Jules stumbled across Micah's blog as was intrigued by his description of his dreams, and they quickly developed a rapport. He always believed the dreams meant something, and this belief increased dramatically when the first hints of true future-sight started emerging.

He was against Micah's use of prescribed drugs to suppress his dreams, partially because they were useful, potentially life-saving things, and partially because he had memories--- and greater understanding, now that he was older--- of how his own prescription had affected him, and didn't wish anything like that on Micah--- the exacerbated powers or negative reaction of his mother. Still, he supported his friend's decision to take them, at least hoping that they'd let Micah sleep easier.

The hope for more, romantically and sexually, was always there, nearly from the start, but Jules knew he'd have a long way to go with Micah, and that his friend would have to be the one to make the first move. That didn't preclude teasing, of course, which Jules indulged in liberally.

## Lucian Sharpe
-------------

![](https://slimwiki.com/api/accounts/the-real-unholy-trinity/attachments/62624)

His friendship with Luci formed alongside his friendship with Micah, around the time they were all 15. Luci came across Micah's blog at the same time as Jules, and their shared interests--- not only their curiosity of Micah and his dreams--- brought them together. After hearing just a little about Luci's blackouts, Jules was certain they were something supernatural. He encouraged Luci's investigations of them, but also advised caution--- they had no idea what was on the other side of them, after all.

The hope for more, romantically and sexually, was always there, nearly from the start, but Jules could tell that Luci wouldn't start anything without Micah, and so decided on a waiting game. As with Micah, that in no way precluded teasing, which Luci was much more likely to play along with.

## Lucifer
-------

![](https://slimwiki.com/api/accounts/the-real-unholy-trinity/attachments/62649)

### Before Reveal

In the beginning, Lucifer (Vessel FC: Evan Peters) was merely another sketchy client. It took a few hints of more intimate knowledge of Jules and his life for Jules to take an interest in him, but they quickly fell into a more-than-associates-less-than-friends accord. Lucifer asked for odd things sometimes, but never anything Jules had strong moral qualms with, and he paid good.

Jules often wondered if Lucifer might not be some kind of seer, like Micah, and so kept his questions about the man's knowledge of him quiet after the ones he voiced were rebuffed or ignored.

### After Reveal

Part of Jules couldn't believe he hadn't guessed the 'actual devil Lucifer' thing, but most of him was curious--- even more curious than he'd been before, that was. He was only mildly wary of Lucifer, feeling that he understood the archangel well enough to keep on good terms with him, and quizzed him about the supernatural every chance he got.

T H E   A N T I C H R I S T
---------------------------

The Antichrist is said to oppose Christ and appear at the End of Days. He would draw people in with displays of power and modesty in the face of praise. Social justice causes would find a determined fighter in him. Until the end of the world was upon them, he would seem the perfect leader--- and then, according to biblical stories, he would reveal his true despicable nature.

In practice, the Antichrist can see souls, do magic, and feel himself falling more in love with the False Prophet and Lucifer's vessel every passing day. Anything else is up in the air.

Powers
------

### Aura Sight

![](https://slimwiki.com/api/accounts/the-real-unholy-trinity/attachments/62592)

Everyone has an aura, a colorful glow that surrounds them and reflects their intense emotions, health, and sins. Nothing is labelled, or visible in any kind of detail, but it's all there, waiting for the right eyes to come along and see it.

**Sins** are black against the backdrop of the rest of the soul, seen like burnt out lights in a neon sign. The closer to the head and face, the greater the sin. The bigger they are, the more a person dwells on and regrets them.

**True Faces** are visible to those with the ability to see auras, though they aren't directly connected. The True Face is the real appearance of a non-human behind the magic that masks them from human sight. Jules has learned to somewhat suppress his view of True Faces, so that only a foggy outline is superimposed over human features.

**Departing Souls** can be seen because the aura accompanies them into death. Up close, a soul leaving a mortal body seems to pool at the person's feet like a puddle of water before moving away. They then shoot up into the sky, rising no matter what kind of person they were, and eventually disappear from view.

### Magic

![](https://slimwiki.com/api/accounts/the-real-unholy-trinity/attachments/62594)

Although it has many functions unaltered, such as generating light or energy bolts, magic is regularly manipulated into specific forms with specific purposes.

**Necromancy** is the art of reviving the dead and of pulling souls back from beyond the veil. It is often thought to apply only to humans and animals, but can in fact be used on nearly anything that was once alive. Jules has used it to keep his snake alive against all odds, turn paper back into a tree, and ketchup back into a tomato. Once, under extreme duress, he manage to revive his own dead cells and, with the addition of nearby dead leaves, healed a fatal wound.

**Teleportation** is moving from one place to another instantaneously. Jules can travel great distances this way, but only if he's well rested, focused, and can visualize his destination clearly.

**A perception filter** telepathically misdirects a person's attention, so that the filter goes unnoticed and unremarked upon because it seems, to the misdirected, unimportant and uninteresting. Jules can function as one, allowing him to sneak into places he may not have been able to otherwise. For much of his time homeless, it manifested subconsciously when he needed it, but upon realizing his powers, he has used it often intentionally.

**The elements **include fire, earth, wind, water, darkness, and light. Jules can control each, to degrees that vary based on his level of energy and concentration.

**Telekinesis** is the ability to move things with the mind. Small uses of this are difficult for Jules, as are huge ones, but moving things between his size and the size of house is simple, unless the mass of such an object is enormous.

**Healing** is the art of mending wounds and curing maladies. To do this, Jules stimulates the growth of the cells he wants to heal, speeding up the body's natural healing process with his own energy. In the case of illnesses, which he is much less practiced in, he hastens the production of antibodies in the bloodstream.

Limitations
-----------

Jules's magic is often quite visible and conspicuous when it's in use. Even dormant, it makes him easy to spot by other supernatural beings. Also, the more frequent or sizable the magic, the more it takes out of him to perform--- not only because of the energy required, but also the amount of concentration. Most spells need at least moderate focus to execute, as well as great amounts of practice to cultivate safe and effective magic. Too little power, and the spell might fail; too much, and it could break free of Jules's control, or he might simply pass out from exhaustion in the attempt.

Other than his magical abilities, Jules has all the constraints of an average human. He can fight to an extent, but in a magic-less battle with the supernatural, it'd be his quick thinking and quicker feet that got him out of trouble. Or, in a pinch, Godric has been known to protect him with a well-placed bite.

His status as the Antichrist makes Jules mildly-to-moderately allergic to anything ritually blessed in the name of any of the members of the Holy Trinity, including but not limited to: holy water, communion wafers and wine, ash, rosaries, and the consecrated ground of churches and graveyards. Allergic reactions can involve burning him upon contact, making him nauseous and lightheaded, or causing a drastic spike in anxiety at the feeling of being very, very unwelcome. Hearing or being involved in prayer will quickly bring on a headache, or even a migraine if forced to remain for an entire mass.

Outside Response
----------------

Other supernaturals tend to avoid Jules. Answering too many questions--- even simple ones--- before the time is right is not done. His struggles with finding an apartment(or a roommate, or even a friend that would consistently let him sleep on their couch) was due, in part, to this.  Also, it is known that to give the Antichrist safe harbor is to mess up the plans of more than one supernatural powerhouse--- giving the Unholy Trinity a base of operations much too soon, and with much less necessary hardship undergone to obtain it.

E T Y M O L O G Y
-----------------

**Julian: **From the Latin Julianus, which is a derivative of Julius, an old Roman family name thought to be derived from Iulus (the first down on the chin, downy-bearded). Because a person just beginning to develop facial hair is young, "youth" became an accepted meaning of the name.

**Gabriel: **A Hebrew given name meaning "God is my strength."

**Casimir:** An English, French, and Latin form of the Polish name Kazimierz. It may mean "someone who destroys opponent's prestige/glory during battle," and is derived from the Slavic elements: *kaziti* "to destroy" and *měr* "prestige, fame." The latter element is often conflated with the word *mir* ("peace, world") and the former element is suggested to derive from *kazati* "to show," thus some sources translate the name as "the one who reveals or establishes peace."
